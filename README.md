I have a few projects that you can check out currentely on my profile like a reddit scrapper that can post pictures to Instagram immediately based on the subreddit of your choice and also a simple social media app that you can try out! Currentely, I am working on a NBA game guesser and am looking to publish that on the cloud soon! If you have experience in front end development or social media marketing, shoot me a message and we can collaborate!
