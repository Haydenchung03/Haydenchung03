### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Hayden and I am a second year Computer Science at Carleton University. I have a few projects that you can check out currentely on my profile like a reddit scrapper that can post pictures to instagram immediately based on the subreddit of your choice and also a simple social media app that you can try out! Currentely, I am working on a NBA game guesser and am looking to publish that on the cloud soon!
